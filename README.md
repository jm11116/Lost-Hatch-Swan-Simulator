# Lost-Hatch-Swan-Simulator
A simulation of the countdown timer in the Swan Station from the TV show Lost.

How to use:
When the alarm sounds, you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor. Until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the Degroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the Dharma Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.
