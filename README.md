# Lost-Hatch-Swan-Simulator
An (incomplete) simulation of the countdown timer in the Swan Station from the TV show Lost.

# How to use
When the alarm sounds, you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor. Until your replacements arrive, the future of the project is in your hands. On behalf of the Degroots, Alvar Hanso and all of us at the Dharma Initiative, thank you. Namaste. And good luck.

# Notes
- Includes subtle film grain to make the simulation look less like a still image.
